## Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Asal and I am thrilled to share my journey with you. After exploring various fields, I have finally found my true passion in the world of data. Over the past ten months, I have been immersing myself in this exciting field and have been expanding my knowledge by learning new tools and techniques in data world such as Python, SQL, Machine Learning and more. Currently, I am enrolled in Data Analysis Bootcamp at Monash universty, where I am gaining hands-on experience and building projects that showcase my skills. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to sharing my progress with you.
