### Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Asal and I am thrilled to share my journey with you. After exploring various fields, I have finally found my true passion in the world of data. Over the past ten months, I have been immersing myself in this exciting field and have been expanding my knowledge by learning new tools such as Python, SQL, and more. Currently, I am enrolled in Data Analysis Bootcamp at Monash universty, where I am gaining hands-on experience and building projects that showcase my skills. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and look forward to sharing my progress with you.
