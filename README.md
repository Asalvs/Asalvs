Currently, I am enrolled in Monash University's Data Analysis Bootcamp, where I am gaining hands-on experience and building projects that showcase my skills. Soon, I will begin my career as a Fraud Analyst at NAB, and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me. I'm excited to share my progress with you, and thank you for stopping by my page.
